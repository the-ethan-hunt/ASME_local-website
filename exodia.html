    <p><h4>September 15 is celebrated every year in India as Engineer’s Day to commemorate the birthday of the legendary engineer Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya . Due to his outstanding contribution to the society, <b>Government of India conferred ‘Bharat Ratna’ on this legend</b> in the year 1955. He was also <b>awarded the British Knighthood by King George V, and hence has the honorific “Sir”.</b></h4></p><br><br><br>
    <p><h4>Every year on Engineer’s Day we at GCET celebrate it in an innovative way through EXODIA. Every year GCET ASME Student Chapter organizes EXODIA on <b>15th of September</b>. Exodia aims towards bringing out the techie of every student in quite innovative ways. Exodia is a college level event where various technical and non-technical events are organized so that overall a student can present himself/herself confidently and apply the knowledge he/she receives through lectures. It is followed by Expert Lectures given by prominent people in some or the other fields which can motivate them and give an idea about what today’s Industry Requires and what are the Automations that are happening around us.</h4></p><br><br>
    <p><h4>EXODIA is done by the students and for the students. Through EXODIA we try to provide a platform for techies of all ages to showcase their technical side and develop their soft skills through Presentation and Poster Competitions.</h4></p>
